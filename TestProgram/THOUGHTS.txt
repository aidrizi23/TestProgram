first i need to deal with the creation of the question.
at the same time will be creating the options for the multiple choice question.
after these are done and correctly related to one another will create the test
the test will be related to the teacher and student that will create and take it respectively
than the questions will be related to the test asnd aftter that we will be able to make it so that the test is created first
than the questions and for each question that we will need the options will be created
will also need a student test class that will have the info for each student and for each test and then a studdentanswwer class that will have
the info for each student for each question of a specific test
